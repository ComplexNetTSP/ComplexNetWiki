### National Radiation Database (NSRDB)

The NSRDB is a serially complete collection of hourly and half-hourly values of the three most common measurements of solar radiation maintained by the NREL. These data have been collected at a sufficient number of locations and temporal and spatial scales to accurately represent regional solar radiation climates.
