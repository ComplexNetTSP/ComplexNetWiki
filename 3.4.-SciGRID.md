The SciGRID project aims at extracting the topologies of power grids using OpenStreetMap data. There is no inference, only available data is used. The main idea is to filter data from OSM based on the power relation that must be indicated by OSM users as they map. This is a common habit in Germany, but not necessarily in all other european countries. See [http://www.scigrid.de/](http://www.scigrid.de/).

SciGRID contains a subproject called GridKit that does not require the power relation. See [https://github.com/bdw/GridKit](https://github.com/bdw/GridKit)
