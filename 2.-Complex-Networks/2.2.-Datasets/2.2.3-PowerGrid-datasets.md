# Power Grid Datasets

## SciGrid

### Description

SciGRID is a project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Its intention is to develop methods for the automated generation of models (i.e. maps) of existing electricity grids for research and other purposes. The focus will be on the European transmission grids, but the methods will be applicable more generally. Both the resulting methods and the derived data will be published free of charge under appropriate open source licenses in the course of the project and intends to increase the general availability of network models and their overall quality.

The SciGRID model is written in Python and is mainly based on the "power" relations data available in openstreetmap.org under the Open Database License (ODbL). The "power" relations from OpenStreetMap (OSM) are filtered and exported to relational databases where they are used to build the abstracted transmission network. The relational database approach allows for a flexible and a modular structure of the SciGRID model.
