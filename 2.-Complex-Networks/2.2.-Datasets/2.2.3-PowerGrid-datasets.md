### Description

SciGRID is a project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Its intention is to develop methods for the automated generation of models (i.e. maps) of existing electricity grids for research and other purposes. The focus will be on the European transmission grids, but the methods will be applicable more generally. Both the resulting methods and the derived data will be published free of charge under appropriate open source licenses in the course of the project and intends to increase the general availability of network models and their overall quality.

The SciGRID model is written in Python and is mainly based on the "power" relations data available in openstreetmap.org under the Open Database License (ODbL). The "power" relations from OpenStreetMap (OSM) are filtered and exported to relational databases where they are used to build the abstracted transmission network. The relational database approach allows for a flexible and a modular structure of the SciGRID model.

## The RE-Europe data set

Territory covered = Europe
Type of network =  
Number of nodes =
Number of edges =
project status =

### Description

This data set models the continental European electricity system, including demand and renewable energy inflows for the period 2012-2014.

The main features of the data set are:

- High resolution (~50km, 1 hour) and large extent (Mainland Europe, 3 years)
- Technical and economic characteristics of generators from real-world data and best available estimates
- Synthetic wind and solar observations and forecasts from numerical weather prediction models, describing the full spatio-temporal structure of the wind

The transmission system comprises 1494 buses and 2156 lines. For each bus, signals for load, wind and solar production is given for each hour of the three years, with the wind and solar signals based on meteorological weather data.
Further, at hour 00 and 12, forecasts for the solar and wind production are given for the following 91 hours, based on weather data.
All spatially-distributed data is aggregated to the nodal domain by summation/averaging over the area closest to each node.
Wind and solar signals and forecast are given as capacity factors, i.e. production relative to rated power.

### Description

This project aims at the mapping of the french power grid. Most of the data comes from EDF (main producer), RTE (national transport network and cross border links), and ERDF (main distribution network).
